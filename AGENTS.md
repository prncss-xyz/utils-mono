Astryx
CLI: run every command as `pnpm --prefix apps/web exec astryx --dense <cmd>` (shown below as `astryx ...`).

WORKFLOW — discover, don't guess. Before writing UI:

1. `astryx build "<idea>"` — START HERE: returns a kit (closest [page] + [block]s + [component]s). No args = full playbook.
2. `astryx template <name> [--skeleton]` — scaffold the [page]/[block]s it named, or study their layout. Templates are reference code.
3. `astryx component <Name>` — props + examples for every component you use.

RULES:

- No <div> — components do all layout/spacing. Full page → AppShell; sidebar nav → SideNav.
- Frame first: pick the shell (AppShell / Layout+LayoutPanel) and budget regions in px BEFORE writing content (`astryx docs layout`).
- Dense data = rows (Table, List/Item) edge-to-edge — never Card-wrapped list items. Card = dashboard widgets, galleries, settings groups only.
- Status → StatusDot/Token; Badge only for counts and enumerated states, never decoration.
- Custom styling: component props first; else style/className with tokens — var(--color-_|--spacing-_|--radius-*). No raw hex/px. (No StyleX/Tailwind compiler here — don't use xstyle/utility classes.)
- Tokens for every value (`astryx docs tokens`). Brand/accent via `astryx theme` — never override --color-* in :root.
- SELF-CHECK before you finish: re-read the file and replace any raw <div>/<span> layout, imported .css/@apply, or hardcoded value (#hex, 16px) with the component or a token (var(--color-_|--spacing-_|…)). If unsure a component/prop exists, run `astryx component <Name>` / `astryx search "<thing>"`; don't hand-roll CSS.

MORE CLI:
search "<query>" find any component / hook / doc / template / block
component --list components by category
template --list page + block recipes
docs <topic> color, elevation, icons, illustrations, internationalization, layout, migration, motion, principles, shape, spacing, styling, theme, tokens, typography
swizzle <Name> eject component source for deep customization
upgrade --apply run after any @astryxdesign/core bump
